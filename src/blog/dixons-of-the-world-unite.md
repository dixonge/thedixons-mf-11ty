[Revised July 1, 2018]

My original idea below has been superceded by the following:

1. I am now using [WikiTree](https://wikitree.com) for all my online genealogy. It has connected me to other Dixon genealogists more than any other source. It solves two problems &#8211; finding other fellow researchers and having a way to collaborate with them.
  
2. An actual Dixon/Dickson Family Association is in the works, spearheaded by Brent Dickson frm the U.K. I'll post details when it is up and running.

Original post follows:

----------------------
  
I have spent much of my free time today scouring the internet for Dixon family information. I refuse to believe that I’m the only Dixon descendant doing so, yet sometimes it feels that way. Queries and pieces of information scattered throughout the world. Somewhere &#8212; in some dusty attic in Indiana, or some library shelf or storage room in Delaware, or some computer database in Scotland not connected to the internet, or some Parish register in Ireland in some basement &#8212; are the details of my ancestors. I know they are there, I just can’t get to them! And what is worse is that some of their owners don’t seem to care.

I can’t necessarily do anything about that, but I can do something about my fellow Dixon researchers. Many of them have run into brick walls and dead ends. All they know is a name, maybe a death date, maybe a city and state. Beyond that it is all black. Now, again I can’t necessarily do anything about that for most researchers, but for Dixon researchers I am determined to help! And my desire is also somewhat selfish as I intend to help myself. I want us to all connect and pool our data, our information, our contacts. And I have been wanting to do this for a long time and have, for some reason, kept putting it off. I obsess over the details and leave the shovel leaning against the shed. But no more, I hereby announce the following:

I am hereby starting the Dixon Family Association

I envision this entity to eventually include all descendants of not only Henry Dixon (b. 1633) but the descendants of one Thomas Dicson born some time in the 13th century. Now normally it would be quite silly to imagine that this was possible. But times are changing. The [Dixon DNA Project][1] (administered by Susan Branam) has 225 members and hudreds of participating testers! Click the link, and you can see the current results and sign up for your very own DNA test.

Keep checking this site for future updates and extra web pages with details of how you can join up. For now, leave me a message in the comments below!
